        While every member of a team has an important role to play, the team captain is an especially important part of any team. Everyone is familiar with captains and the status they have in their positions. Of course, like most team sports, hockey teams select a captain to take on extra responsibilities and help guide the team to success. While you might know that captains are often seen as the leaders and top players of a team, you might not know what their actual responsibilities are.

        Responsibilities of Team Captains
        <br>
        <br>
        Captains can have a range of responsibilities and expectations within a team, including ceremonial and social responsibilities. While team captains are typically seen as representatives of the team, they have one official distinction from the rest of their teammates. Team captains are the only team members with the ability to discuss questions relating to the interpretation of the rules during the game with the referee. However, this does not include complaints about a penalty, which will result in a minor penalty.
